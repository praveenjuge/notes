# Sleep 

For me it's pretty much down to this:
1) Consistent exercise
2) Eating reasonably healthy
3) Avoid blue light after dark as much as possible
4) No eating after 8pm (water and herbal tea are fine).
5) No problem solving after 8pm
6) No caffeine after 3pm. (I usually have a couple of cups of tea in the morning)
Basically I feel like my body needs to be physically tired and well fed to need sleep, and then it needs to be warned in advance that the day is over and we're winding down: stop eating, stop working, use lights that don't mimic daylight (including screen if possible) but instead mimic candle/firelight.

CPAP has made a difference. In fact, not only does it help my sleep but I think it helps allergies as well, IE: the air filtration helps avoid my previous morning allergy attack as I coughed and sneezed out all the junk that had accumulated in my sinuses during the night. Also - it must be doing something for me, because for the first time in my life I awaken before my alarm clock and I feel rested.
When I'm going to the gym regularly / having sufficient physical activity, I noticed that I slept better as well. Not from exhaustion, but simply a more restful sleep.
As I age... cutting coffee and sugars earlier in the day. As others have said, alcohol can keep you up all night burning through those sugars.
Regularity in sleep matters too. We stayed up too late last night watching movies and even though I was exhausted, I didn't sleep restfully. Better to go to sleep at a regular time and awaken at a normal time too. If your schedule is flexible, there's a lot to be said for letting your body awaken when it is ready rather than by alarm clock.
Unless you have something clearly medical going on, I'm not personally keen on the various supplements or drugs.
One other thought - now that I have my cpap, I don't find myself needing to nap in the afternoons quite so much. That said, I think there is a lot to be said for siesta and for understanding the seasons. It's darn hot where I am right now, and the smart thing to do is basically get up early with the sun and work while it is still cool, then nap in the afternoons while it is so hot. Seasons definitely have an impact on sleep.
edit: I also think there's something to be said for eating in moderation. Big meals might temporarily make you want to fall asleep, but then you've got all that energy to burn and you wake up in the middle of the night. Or, it gives you heartburn, etc and wakes you up. Or you find yourself having to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night.

Keeping the temperature of the bedroom cold made a big difference for me.
I’ve been listening to audiobooks and podcasts for years and that helped better than not, but turning the radiator off and ensuring the bedroom was cold meant the vast majority of nights meant I went from listening at least an hour a night to often falling asleep within 15mins or less.
I had read Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker and I highly recommend it. Changed my attitude completely - it’s now higher priority.

I very recently solved my sleep problems which had been bothering me for a couple of years.
   1. I cut my caffeine intake to zero. 
   2. I forced myself to sleep at about the same time each night. (most important)
   3. I stopped using alarms. I wake up when I need to.
   4. I wear a sleeping mask which helps me get an hour more of sleep. Otherwise I'd be awake at the first lights of dawn. 
Once your circadian rhythm is retuned, points 1 and 2 stop being so important. I no longer have trouble sleeping if I drink a cup of coffee. And if I go to sleep late once or twice, it does not ruin my sleeping for the rest of the week.

Getting sun every day. It's remarkable how much a difference it makes in causing me to feel tired at night

For me it was the coffee. I had to quit. I was surprised how hard it was! Currently I'm at 1 tablespoon (I think 100mg) mixed in decaf with my french press. In addition to that my doctor suggested Ashwagandha and Holy Basil. I also use a weighted blanket. I'm a fan of a big pillow under my legs. Regular sleep schedule. Elon Musk suggested tilting your bed and not eating 4 hours before going to bed, that might help as well.  
But I'm 90% sure cutting the caffine was the magic bullet.

Exercise and some meditation practice.

I find Valerian and chamomile tea help. Also turning off & moving my phone into another room to stop me checking it helps. I signal to my brain that it's time to sleep. I get racing thoughts, but that usually subsides after about an hour. If the thoughts are overly intrusive, I take notes, since they could be useful ideas to execute on in the morning.
